# Assessment 3 - React

## **Overview**

This is the third assessment of our HTMElephant cohort. This time we will be focusing on what you've learned in React. In this assessment you will be creating a multi-page web app using React. The design of the website is up to you, but it should be a website that you would be proud to show off to your classmates (which you will do!) as long as the app meets the requirements listed below.

You will be making a multi page web app that uses React Router to navigate between pages. You will also be using an API to get data for your app. You will be using Axios to make HTTP requests to your API. You will also be using at least one instance of `useState` and `useEffect` in your app.

You will have 3 class days for this project - please spend some time planning out your app before you start coding (you might be able to find an API for your idea instead of making an idea around an API!). You will be presenting your app to the class on the 3rd day.

## **Requirements**

This app should fit the following criteria:

### **React**

- [ ] Use React to build the app
- [ ] Use React Router to create a multi-page app
- [ ] Use at least one instance of `useState`
- [ ] Use at least one instance of `useEffect`
- [ ] Use a minimum of 5 components
- [ ] Style your app using CSS - it has to look presentable. What that means is up to you.
- [ ] Use at least one image in your app

### **Routing**

- [ ] Use React Router to create a home page
- [ ] Use React Router to create a page with a route parameter (such as an id)
- [ ] Use React Router to create a 404 page

### **API**

- [ ] Use an API to get data for your app
- [ ] Use Axios to make HTTP requests to your API
- [ ] Add the ability to reload the data from the API using a button
